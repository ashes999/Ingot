# Ingot

Ingot is a tool for writing functional/integration tests against web applications. GET/POST URLs, fill out forms, and more!

Currently, the only viable tool in the .NET ecosystem is NHtmlUnit, which is a .NET port of a Java tool. Ingot hopes to fill that gap, and provide a more user-friendly testing library.
